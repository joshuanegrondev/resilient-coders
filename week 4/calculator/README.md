How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6.

This calculator was done by manipulating the DOM and with four different function. One function for each operation (e.g. +, - , / , and multiplication)

Optimizations

I added some media queries to make it responsive in any device.

Lessons Learned:
Javascript is the first programming language that I tackled in my journey of becoming a software engineer. I learned that in Javascript a clean and nice code is worth gold because everyone can understand it and you can find the bugs easily. Doing this project the first day that I learned Javascript was a little bit frustrating at first, but the more I learned the faster I did it. I'm proud of this work. Check it out.
