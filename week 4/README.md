# Week 4 of Resilient Coders Bootcamp
Week 4 of the resilientcoders.org bootcamp as part of the 2020b cohort.

## What I Learned
This week was my first introduction to a programming language: JavaScript.

I used different things such as loops, conditionals, functions, etc., combined with HTML and CSS to create full stack applications that are both responsive and run as wished.

### Content
This week contains the following projects:

Calculator: 4 simple mathematical functions.
FizzBuzz: A simple program that runs in the console.
Horoscope: A Star Wars themed horoscope program.
RPS: A rock, paper, scissors simulator based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
