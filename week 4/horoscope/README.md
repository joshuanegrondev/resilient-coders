How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6.

Created a horoscope app where the user can enter their birthday and get their horoscope. It has 12 unique horoscopes with a Star wars theme. This project was done by manipulating the DOM and using conditionals and functions in JS ES6.

Optimizations

I added some media queries to make it responsive in any device.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how important it is to write clean code. Conditionals can get a little bit messy if the code is not done right. I kept the code as simple as possible; all of this helped to fix bugs and accelerate the completion of a project. Check your horoscope and which Star War character you are.
