# Rock paper or scissors: Learning Javascript - Week 4
## I learned Javascript ES6 and did this Rock-Paper-Scissors game in just a day. Check it out.

Fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game with an Avatar The Last Airbender theme. Check it out and play.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6.

Created a rock, paper or scissors game where the bot generates a random number and based on a random number it gives you an assigned weapon based on the functions and conditionals that I wrote in JS. After the bot has a weapon, which happens at the first time you choose a weapon. Depending on your and the bot's weapon there's another function that decides if you lost, won or tie. Based on the situations, the DOM is manipulated and increased score and appear a message in any given situation.

Assigning global variables, the use of different functions for weapons, score and the way that they manipulate the DOM was how I tackled this project. Check the code and look how clean it is!

Instead of the traditional way of rock, paper or scissors, I used water, fire and earth to be more aligned with the theme of the game. In this game the character beat each other depending on the elements. Katara (water) beats Zuko (fire), Zuko (fire) beats Toph (earth), and Toph (earth) beats Katara (water).

Optimizations

I added some media queries to make it responsive in any device.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use different functions and made them work together. As in any project, it was important for me to write the code as clean and nice as possible for improvements. I learned one of the most important and difficult tasks in JS which is making the functions work together in certain situations and depending the situation the DOM was manipulated it. Check it out! I'm sure you'll like it.
