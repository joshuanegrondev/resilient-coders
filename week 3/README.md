## I learned responsiveness in just one week. Check it out.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5 and CSS3 (Responsiveness)

The documents in this week contains several replicated pages that I made and made it responsive so they can be adapted to every kind of devices.

Optimizations

I made a few tweaks so they look better than how it started.

Lessons Learned:
Learning responsiveness was not hard. Once you fully understand the concept of media queries and how they are applied you can make any website responsive. That is basically what I did. I feel proud of my work since this was only done in 5 days. I encourage you to check it out and look for yourself.
