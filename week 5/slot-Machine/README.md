I made this cool slot machine just by learning JavaScript in 2 days. This slot machine keeps track of the user's score and whenever the user is losing or going to lose all the money, the page has an alert.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

I created global variables, so I can use them later in the functions. I created different functions where the computer gets random fruits and manipulate the DOM. My code is understandable, concise and clean. I also used pure functions whenever they were possible.

Optimization:
I added some media query so it can be responsive on all devices.

Lessons Learned:
This was my very first project that I created everything from scratch, and by everything I mean HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. No templates or imported code were used. This made me realized how important it is JavaScript in the daily life of a user. With this in mind, I learned that when starting in JavaScript bugs could be a common thing, and that's why I created this code in a clean and understandable way, so I can recognize and fix the bugs. Take a look, and enjoy the Minecraft thing. I hope you like the project the same way I did when I was creating it!
