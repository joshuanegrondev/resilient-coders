# Learning CSS3 - Week 2
## I learned CSS3 in just one week and I replicated all the websites assigned. All of this was done from scratch and in a week.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5 and CSS3

With the help of guided mentor I taught myself CSS3 and made all these projects. This is the first time I tackle CSS3.

Note: This does not include responsiveness. If you want to see how I tackled responsiveness with CSS3 go to week 3.

Optimizations

I made a few tweaks so they look better than how it started.

Lessons Learned:
Learning CSS3 was a journey, not a bad one tho. I first I did not understand it, but the more I read and created stuff I learned more about floats which was something that I did not know before. Floats made my life easier. Then, after that week I learned about flexbox and realized that everything I did in CSS3 could have been reduced to a few lines of codes but just using flexbox.
